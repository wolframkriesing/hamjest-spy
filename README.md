# hamjest-spy
The simplest spy, providing simple hamjest matchers.

# What is hamjest?
[Hamjest][hamjest] is a great non-intrusive set of matcher functions, that allow to 
combine matchers and make really readable tests.

# How to use

See [the tests][tests] for how I use the spy and the according matchers.
